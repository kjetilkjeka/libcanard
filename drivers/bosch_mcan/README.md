# Libcanard Driver for Bosch Mcan IP

This is a compact and simple driver for STM32 microcontrollers.
It has no dependencies besides a tiny part of the standard C library,
and can be used with virtually any operating system or on bare metal.

In theory, the all MCUs using the Bosch MCAN IP should be supported by this driver,
So far this driver has been tested with the following MCU:
- AtsamV71Q21B
